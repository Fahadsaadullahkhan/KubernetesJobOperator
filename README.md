# Airflow KubernetesJobOperator

An airflow job operator, for kubernetes. Given a specific yaml or image and command,
the operator will execute a Kuberntes Job.

# ALPHA
This repository is in alpha testing, and is published
to allow contribution.

# Why not use the [kubernetes pod operator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes_pod_operator.p)?

the kubernetes Job object allows for more definitions such as retries/timeouts/deadlines/replicas/etc.. which cannot be defined in directly on a pod. 

Also, the connection between the pod and the worker can be lost, due to communication issues,
pod death or just pod scheduling issues while for the a Job (a definition in kubernetes)
we would lose the state of the job only if the job is deliberately deleted.

## Open issues for beta
1. Correction of the kuberntes watcher to allow restart of the watch process
if connection is lost.
