# Airflow KubernetesJobOperator

An airflow job operator that executes a task as a Kubernetes job on a cluster, given
a job yaml configuration or an image uri.

Two operators are available:
1. KubernetesJobOperator - The main kubernetes job operator.
1. KubernetesLegacyJobOperator - A operator that accepts the same parameters as
the KubernetesPodOperator and allows seamless integration between old and new.

Still missing (on both):
1. XCom

# ALPHA

This repository is in alpha testing, and is published
to allow contribution.

# Why not use the [kubernetes pod operator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes_pod_operator.p)?

The kubernetes Job allows for more execution options such as retries/timeouts/deadlines/replicas/etc.. which cannot be defined directly on a pod.

Also, the connection between the pod and the worker can be lost, due to communication issues,
pod deletions or just pod scheduling issues in the cluster. The Kubernetes Job is more like a "definition" of pending execution, we therefore would lose the state of the job only if the job is deliberately deleted. A job will also recover automatically from pod manual deletions and pod scheduling errors.

You can find a description of the kubernetes Job resource [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/)

## Open issues needed for beta release

1. Correction of the kuberntes watcher to allow restart of the watch process
   if connection is lost.
