# Airflow KubernetesJobOperator

An airflow job operator, for kubernetes. Given a specific yaml or image and command,
the operator will execute a Kuberntes Job.

# ALPHA

This repository is in alpha testing, and is published
to allow contribution.

# Why not use the [kubernetes pod operator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes_pod_operator.p)?

The kubernetes Job allows for more execution options such as retries/timeouts/deadlines/replicas/etc.. which cannot be defined directly on a pod.

Also, the connection between the pod and the worker can be lost, due to communication issues,
pod deletions or just pod scheduling issues in the cluster. The Kubernetes Job is a definition in kubernetes, we therefore would lose the state of the job only if the job is deliberately deleted.A job will also recover, by itself, from pod manual deletions and pod scheduling errors.

You can find a description of the kubernetes Job object [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/)

## Open issues needed for beta release

1. Correction of the kuberntes watcher to allow restart of the watch process
   if connection is lost.
